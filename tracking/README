 C/C++ implementation of the module track2.m (see comments in this file)

 Track cells in a greedy fashion (time slice by time slice) by 
 minimizing a simple energy function (mainly based on distances) via
 Integer Linear Programming.

 Implementation is geared towards trivial (data-parallel) parallelization.

  Requires the following 3rd party libraries:
 - LP_SOLVE or CPLEX for mixed-integer programming 
   http:lpsolve.sourceforge.net/5.5/
   http:www.ilog.com/products/cplex/
 - HDF5 for input and output data storage
   http:www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/
 - ANN for efficient nearest-neighbor search

 If CPLEX shall be used as optimization engine, this program has to be built
 with the USE_CPLEX flag.

 Changelog:
 1.4 -- program structure refactoring and CMake support
 1.3 -- optional support for using CPLEX as a MIP engine
 1.2 -- allow for nonisotropic voxel sizes

If you want to use CPLEX, you must export an environment variable ILOG_LICENSE_FILE
that has to give the path of your personal copy of access.ilm.
